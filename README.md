### ISY503 Intelligent Systems - Final Project

#### Project Overview
This repository contains the final project for ISY503 Intelligent Systems, focused on applying foundational principles of AI to a Computer Vision project. The project's goal is to train a model on sample data for a self-driving simulation, ensuring the car does not crash or leave the road.

#### Getting Started
To run this project locally, you will need a Python environment with Django installed. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PavelBryz/ISY503.git

4. **Set Up the Project**:
   - Execute the following command: 
     ```bash
     run python manage.py migrate
     ```
   - This will set up the database schema.
6. **Run the Django Development Server**:
   - Execute the following command: 
     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver
     ```
   - This will start the server on `localhost:8000`.
